- **2017-10-06 (Start using [StandardJS](https://github.com/standard/standard))**
I am starting using [StandardJS](https://github.com/standard/standard) for my Javascript projects, which is really nice to have a tool and standard of Javascript coding style. I used to use [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) but it needs nodejs handy inside the project and default formatting of VSCode which is simply code. But I think that StandardJS would be truly a standard of Javascript.

- **2017-10-02 (Finish Angularizing [Portfolio](https://iamstevendao.github.io/portfolio/))**  
From the purpose of [replacing the whole content](https://iamstevendao.github.io/blog/general/2017/09/27/angularize-portfolio.html) into **JSON** files to handle by AngularJS, I totally replaced everything in JQuery by AngularJS. It took awhile to transfer easy-jquery stuff like **background-image slides**, **hovering** and **scroll** effects.

- **2017-09-28 (Finish [Pacman C++](https://github.com/iamstevendao/pacman_cpp))**  
I have been spending a lot of time trying to figure out how the game is so laggy until I have a talk with my C++ teacher, he advised me about use the RELEASE version instead because of the [iterations problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12631609/why-is-this-code-100-times-slower-in-debug) in the Debug mode of Visual C++ 2010. It turns out to work perfectly in the release mode.

- **2017-09-24 (Start with Socket Programming at work)**
I did a lot of Socket and TCP/IP recently at work since I need to create a TCP/IP server and clients to apply widely for my company. It works in C#, probably with a process running in the background only, but we need to consider about UI/UX later. The tests and practices are being updated into [socket-program](https://github.com/iamstevendao/socket-program).

- **2017-09-23 (Use AngularJS for my portfolio website)**
Finally I have some jobs to make learning [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) not that boring, by using AngularJS for my [portfolio](https://iamstevendao.github.io/portfolio/). By applying [$http.get](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http) to read JSON files instead of manually inserting in HTML file, it looks really good now, (not what it shows but the things behind).

- **2017-09-19 (Start on [OneForth](https://github.com/iamstevendao/oneForth), a Desktop client for Everything I & you love)**  
*14:30* : Trying to push some Angularjs into my head  
*14:50* : Enchanted by a video about [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) even this was the second time I watched it  
*20:00* : Reading, finding projects powered by Electron, got enchanted again >.<  
*23:00* : Come up with an idea about a client for 9gag, messenger, twitter, ... all the things I need to open in my Chrome after get home.  
*24:00* : Create [OneForth](https://github.com/iamstevendao/oneForth), sucessfully open 9GAG (not that bad).
 
- **2017-09-11 (Finishing [Pacman javascript version](https://github.com/iamstevendao/pacman))**
I am so happy right now. There were a lot of painful works to get to this point. I will write a post to celebrate this moment. **Ghosts** are getting smarter by chasing **pacman** in different ways, switching between chasing **pacman** and among **cherries**, and runing away when **pacman** gets its power >.<.This is how the game looks like:

- **2017-09-08 (Implement [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to [Pacman](https://github.com/iamstevendao/pacman))**
I am really tired after such a day, but I need to write something before I forget all about it :)). I am on my way implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm to my Pacman projects, of course javascript version will be applied first.  
Basically it works but doesn't satify me yet. I really want ghosts chase pacman but also have to be by different ways which increases the difficulty of the game. >.<, there are still a lot of things need to be done.  
This is what it looks like so far:

- **2017-09-04 ([Steven's Blog](https://iamstevendao.github.io/blog) to be deployed)**  
I start writing blog (>.<), after found a really impressive persional blog of [Evan Hahn](http://evanhahn.com/). It urged me and I belive I can write my own blog and [my diary](https://github.com/iamstevendao/StevensStory) also be moved into a page: [Steven's Diary](https://iamstevendao.github.io/blog/diary/).  

- **2017-09-02 (Documentation Day)**  
Nothing much special today since I work around documenting and fixing display errors of my [website](https://iamstevendao.github.io/portfolio/), [Naruto website](https://github.com/iamstevendao/Naruto), [AfterAll](https://github.com/iamstevendao/AfterAll) and [Superfast Dictionary](https://github.com/iamstevendao/Superfast-Dictionary). 

- **2017-08-30 ([AfterAll](https://github.com/iamstevendao/AfterAll) & [Superfast-Dictionary](https://github.com/iamstevendao/Superfast-Dictionary) to be open-source)**  
I decide to move my 2 very first projects from Bitbucket to Github. Just wish one day someone find them interesting and continue what I have left.  

- **2017-08-29 ([Pacman C++](https://github.com/iamstevendao/pacman_cpp))**  
My assignment for C++ class at AIT, it was not too hard since I brought the idea of the Pacman I had made in Javascript, but C++ is always challenging. This is a markable point with **the first careful documented project** with a beautiful README (my opinion >.<) by me.  
Wish that I can keep on this habit with every project I jump in.  

- **2017-08-27 (initial commit)**  
As being inspired by many people, articles, I decide to write my dairy (mostly coding dairy) which tells about my path full of trouble learning new stuff and to remind me not to forget (give up) the things I could have finished if I have tried a bit more.  
An interesting thing is, with the availability of thousands of tools, webs supporting blog and diary writing, after 1 hour of signing up, trying, my decision is this 'low-level' text file and to make it as normal Git project >.<.  
Because this is the first commit, then I should summary my coding life to this point:

- **2017-08-20 (LiverStudio to Establish)**  
Establish **LiverStudio** with 1 member (it's me for your concern >.<) with the expectation of releasing 30+ projects named with Liverpool's players. Here is the list and status of them: [LiverStudio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XN6vbJsW4zw5THmVj50cbXyvk0Mu7c9UZGtzwhKGZdQ/edit?usp=sharing).

- **2017-08-01 ([Javascript Games](https://repl.it/@iamstevendao))**  
From the idea of building a bundle of console on-school games running in Cordova, I started build some easy games using pure Javascript, finished: **[Snake](https://repl.it/Jo5Y/34)**, **[Tank](https://repl.it/Jr4p/1)**, **[FlappyBird](https://repl.it/Jrka/31)** and the most complicated one: **[Pacman](https://repl.it/Jv9c/32)** although I really want to apply [Disktra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) make ghosts chasing pacman when I have time.

- **2017-A-day-in-July (Dive into Javascript)**  
After spending hours watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman), I got 'something' with Javascript, it liked a little crush and I just want to jump into it. My Javascript started!!!

- **2017-05-15 ([Front End Development Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/iamstevendao/front-end-certification) at FreeCodeCamp)**  
I found a really good place for practicing front-end things, called [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), I did a lot of Javascript and logic stuffs, most of them was easy because I was on [Codefights](https://codefights.com/profile/steven_dao) a lot before, but there are some really challeging ones. I got the certificate after 2 months of not-really-hard work (>.<)

- **2017-A-day-in-April ([Portfolio](https://iamstevendao.github.io/portfolio/))**  
I got rejected every where I applied for a position, I was asking myself many times, why? I had studied hard, worked hard, got certain achievements that my friends had to be jealous. I knew I could learn fast, do multi tasking but how to show it to recruiters when my English was not good enough, there must be a way. That was the time I started making my [portfolio](https://iamstevendao.github.io/portfolio/) which the idea came from everything inside a code editor. I am so proud of it, many people liked it, and I got more interview than before.

- **2016-A-day-in-June/July ([AfterAll](https://github.com/iamstevendao/AfterAll))**  
I and my girl friend want to store and keep our special dates, we had tried many different apps in Apple and Android store but got satified with non of them (poor design, ads). Then I decided to build our own app. It was roughly finished but I still not publish yet as there are some bugs and I feel really hesitate to fix all of them >.< (I hate myself).

- **2016-03-14 ([Superfast Dictionary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fukie.sieunhanhav))**  
After the meetup about [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), I got curious about **NoSQL**, after try out, I built my first application by 1 week of a painful fighting with **Android Studio** which was a totally strange thing with me. I was very happy because it was the first 'something' I could make my own.

- **2015-A-day-in-September (Get an offer at Kaopiz)**
A really life-changing event, I was just a 2nd year student, with a tiny knowledge of coding, but the Luck came in and I had got a job (>.<). I worked at [Kaopiz](http://kaopiz.com/ja/%E6%A0%AA%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%9A%E7%A4%BE%E3%82%AB%E3%82%AA%E3%83%94%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA/#) in every time I didn't have classes as a freelancer for [Aromajoin](https://aromajoin.com/) where I got to learn a lot of C++ and [Openframework](http://openframeworks.cc/). Never forget that day!
