As a project of my work at [ACE Tuition Center](http://acetuitioncentre.com.au/), a startup with nice people, to create a system for school-teacher-student-parent to help students learn faster and funnier with games, score and quizzes. I am required to work with ASP.NET MVC 5 with AngularJS so my actions will be to go throught the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app-xplat/start-mvc), make an [repo](https://github.com/iamstevendao/hello-world-dotnet) and start diving into it.
