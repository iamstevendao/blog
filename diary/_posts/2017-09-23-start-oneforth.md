*14:30* : Trying to push some Angularjs into my head  
*14:50* : Enchanted by a video about [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) even this was the second time I watched it  
*20:00* : Reading, finding projects powered by Electron, got enchanted again >.<  
*23:00* : Come up with an idea about a client for 9gag, messenger, twitter, ... all the things I need to open in my Chrome after get home.  
*24:00* : Create [OneForth](https://github.com/iamstevendao/oneForth), sucessfully open up 9GAG (not that bad).
