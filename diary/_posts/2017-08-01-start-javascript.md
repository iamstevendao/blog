From the idea of building a bundle of console on-school games running in Cordova, I started build some easy games using pure Javascript, finished: **[Snake](https://iamstevendao.github.io/snake/)**, **[Tank](https://repl.it/Jr4p/1)**, **[FlappyBird](https://repl.it/Jrka/31)** and the most complicated one: **[Pacman](https://github.com/iamstevendao/pacman)** although I really want to apply [Disktra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) make ghosts chasing pacman when I have time.
