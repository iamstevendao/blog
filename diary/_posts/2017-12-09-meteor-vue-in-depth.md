Such a longgggggg time since my last post, I am really excited to get in depth in Meteor and Vue. Sooo many new things have been gone through ([vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/state.html), [vue-supply](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-supply), meteor's subscription, [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router),...), I am feeling so productive. my [meteor-vue-demo](https://github.com/iamstevendao/meteor-vue-demo) is getting bigger and bigger as a simple todos app but the engine behind is various and powerful.
Also I found out that with the availability of technologies, there are sooo many ways can do a same job, so I am a bit confused about choices, does everyone else choose one tech because of its benefit overall or just because they are more familiar with it?
