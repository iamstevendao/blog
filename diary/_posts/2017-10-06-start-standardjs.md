I am starting using [StandardJS](https://github.com/standard/standard) for my Javascript projects, which is really nice to have a tool and standard of Javascript coding style. I used to use [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) but it needs nodejs handy inside the project and default formatting of VSCode which is simply good. But I think that StandardJS would be truly a standard of Javascript.
