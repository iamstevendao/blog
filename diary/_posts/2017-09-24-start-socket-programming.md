I did a lot of Socket and TCP/IP recently at work since I need to create a TCP/IP server and clients to apply widely for my company. It works in C#, probably with a process running in the background only. I created a small [socket-program](https://github.com/iamstevendao/socket-program), which handle pretty much server-client things, both async/sync, also supported multi-client.
