As preparing for something *amazing*, I decide to learn [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and combine them into 1 single [todo app](https://github.com/iamstevendao/meteor-vue-demo). It is **really** hard at first, since Meteor doesn't have an official tutorial for Vue, but luckily there are some examples from [Akryum](https://github.com/meteor-vue/vue-meteor) did help me a lot, but everything still seems so ambiguous so far.
