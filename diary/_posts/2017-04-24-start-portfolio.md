I got rejected every where I applied for a position, I was asking myself many times, why? I had studied hard, worked hard, got certain achievements that my friends had to be jealous. I knew I could learn fast, do multi tasking but how to show it to recruiters when my English was not good enough, there must be a way. That was the time I started making my [portfolio](https://iamstevendao.github.io/portfolio/) which the idea came from everything inside a code editor. I am so proud of it, many people liked it, and I got more interview than before.
