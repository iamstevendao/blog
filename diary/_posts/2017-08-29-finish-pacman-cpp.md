My assignment for C++ class at AIT, it was not too hard since I brought the idea of the Pacman I had made in Javascript, but C++ is always challenging. This is a markable point with **the first careful documented project** with a beautiful README (my opinion >.<) by me.  
Wish that I can keep on this habit with every project I jump in.
