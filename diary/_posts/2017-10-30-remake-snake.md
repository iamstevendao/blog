Remake [Snake](https://github.com/iamstevendao/snake), my very first Javascript game with Phaser.io, it's much easier to handle the built-in physics from Phaser.io than just drawing in HTML Canvas, and it looks more structured with Phaser.io. But I found some cons as well, will find out they are Phaser's limitation or myself doesn't have enough knowledge about Phaser.io
