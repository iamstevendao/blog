I found a really good place for practicing front-end things, called [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), I did a lot of Javascript and logic stuffs, most of them was easy because I was on [Codefights](https://codefights.com/profile/steven_dao) a lot before, but there are some really challeging ones. I got the certificate after 2 months of not-really-hard work (>.<)
