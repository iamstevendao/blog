This post marks the last commit in the series of changes from manually insert into `diary.md` to create new diary posts and use a loop in `diary.md`. I restructure the `scss` files as well as theme of all pages.
Also, I use a new font: [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato), a very good one for long posts.
