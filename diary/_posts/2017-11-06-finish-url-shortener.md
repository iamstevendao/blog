Yay!!! After hours trying to connect NodeJS vs [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) without any hopes, I ended up with [mLab](https://mlab.com/home) and I have to admit that it is much easier. Then I successfully deployed [url-shortener](https://iamsd-url-shortener.glitch.me/), a project at FreeCodeCamp to Glitch.
