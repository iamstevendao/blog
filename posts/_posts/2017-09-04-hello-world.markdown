Today marks the first day of my online blog, but not the start of my journey in I.T. This page will be my place for all raw thoughts I.T related, so whilst I’m aware this page may offer little value to viewers/ be left unread entirely, I appreciate all readers, lovers and haters. 

I will write about all ideas, both good and bad, complete, incomplete, interesting or dull, but I want to save them all to look back on in my later years with appreciation (or laughter at my stupidity >.<).

I have a habit of always being on the hunt for that new exicting project to work on, but then due to lengthy times to completion (partly due to the ambitous nature of the projects I take on :P),  the many obstacles I come across / simply boredom, I tend to switch projects often. This dispersed attention across an array of projects could be seen as a hinderance, although the the positive takeaway is it has lead to a much wider experience of differing softwares, languages and approaches. This resultant experience I would suggest has helped push me more towards being a full-stack developer right ? 

I am looking for a good job with stability that provides both challenging and interesting work that I can fully immerse myself in with pride. *Google*, *Microsoft*, *Amazon*, or *Atlassian* are my targets so far, although I’m also interested in the possibility of startups, which could prove to serve an important role in my growth and development in the industry. But hope is just that….hope. So I don’t want to give them too much energy in order to avoid being too let down. At this stage I will have to keep doing my work, toying with ideas and doing what I love to do, which may even lead to a dream scenario of making my own startup, with my friends. :))

I have my own studio to play around with all my silly ideas by the way, I call it [LiverStudio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XN6vbJsW4zw5THmVj50cbXyvk0Mu7c9UZGtzwhKGZdQ/edit?usp=sharing). Check it out for a list of projects and project status’s. I will be constantly updating LiverStudio with any new ideas I come up with. If anyone wants to join in, they are more than welcome !

That’s probably enough for the first post at this point. If you like, take a look at my [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) or ping me at [@iamstevendao](https://twitter.com/iamstevendao) (I'm new to twitter btw, so I would love to have friends).

And, I would love to say thank you to my friend, [Chris]() who had made this blog less silly.
