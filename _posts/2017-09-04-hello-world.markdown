This seems to be my first post but I really don't know what to talk about. 
This page will be my place for dumb things, so I know that there could be no one interested in it, or I really appreciate if someone reads these things. I will write about my ideas, both *dumb* and *good* ones, both *finished* and *incompleted* ones, both *interested* and *boring* ones but I want to store them, in a place, so that when I become older, when I look back I will know how stupid I was >.<.

I always look for something cool, something new to do, but then like everything else, I get bored because it's hard, it takes me a long time or simply it's boring itself >.<. Because of that, I often switch things and hardly focus on something excepted I am forced to do (assignment, deadlines). But the good point is, I got the overview (even little) of *kinda* many different things, so I will not be dizzy when have to do it for some reasons, because at least I had tried it before, right?

I am looking for a good job, a job which I can totally focus on and be impressed, which also be a good place to stabilize my big part of life. *Google*, *Microsoft*, *Amazon* or *Atlassian* are my target so far, I am so interested in startups, in which I could be an important part and grow with as well. But hope is still hope and I don't want to get hurts, so I have to keep doing my work, my ideas and what I love to do which possibly leads to a beautiful scenario is making my own startup, with my friends. :))
